## Usage

- Download or compile the plugin's JAR file for your platform.
- Move the downloaded JAR file into your server's plugins directory.
- Restart your server.
- Optional: set up bypass permissions.
  - Allocate the `nochat.bypass` permission to users/groups who should bypass the chat restriction.
    - This permission is **not granted to anyone by default**. This means server operators are not
    able to chat by default.
- Optional: Customize the configuration file.
  - For Bukkit-based servers, this is in `plugins/NoChat/config.yml`.
  - If you made any changes to the file, save it and restart your server for them to apply.
- Done, enjoy!
